## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **PHP** - Main programming language
- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Classes and objects
- **Control Structures** - Loops, conditionals
- **Functions** - Code modularization
- **Input/Output** - User interaction

## 📋 Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- `readline` extension enabled (for interactive input)

## 🎮 How to Run

1. Navigate to the kata directory you want to run:
   ```bash
   cd kata55
   ```

2. Execute the PHP file:
   ```bash
   php index.php
   ```

## 📚 Learning

Each kata is designed to practice different concepts:

- **Basic algorithms** (Kata 55, 60)
- **Object-oriented programming** (Kata 57, 59)
- **Data structures** (Kata 58)
- **Game logic** (Kata 57, 58, 59, 60)
- **Input validation** (Kata 55, 60)
- **User interaction** (All katas)
